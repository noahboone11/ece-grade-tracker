## 🔐 How Your Data Works

- Your grades are stored **only** in your browser.
- There's **no syncing**, **no backup**, and **no recovery** if data is cleared.

What this means:
- ✅ Nobody else can access your grades
- ✅ It works offline after the first load
- ❌ You can't sync across devices or browsers
- ❌ You’ll lose everything if you clear browser storage

> 📌 **Best Practice:** Use one browser on one device. Avoid incognito/private mode and don't clear browser data if you want to keep your grades.
