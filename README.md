🔐 How Your Data Works
Your grades are stored only in your browser.

There's no syncing, no backup, and no recovery if data is cleared.

That means:

✅ Nobody else sees your data

✅ It works offline after first load

❌ You can’t access the same account on another device

❌ You’ll lose everything if you clear browser data

📌 Tip: Use one browser on one device, and avoid incognito or clearing storage.
