# üìä ECE Term 4 Grade Tracker

A simple tool to track your MUN ECE Term 4 grades with automatic GPA calculation. Made by a classmate for classmates.

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Just use this link:** https://noahboone11.github.io/ece-grade-tracker

**Demo account to try it out:**
- Username: `demo_student`
- Password: `password123`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Browser-Only Storage

**Your account only exists in the specific browser you create it in.**

- Chrome on your laptop = separate account from Safari on your phone
- Incognito/private browsing = your account won't be there
- Clear browser data = your grades are gone forever
- Different computer = need to create a new account

**This means you should stick to one browser and avoid clearing your browser data if you want to keep your grades.**

## What It Does

- Track grades for all ECE Term 4 courses (both Electrical and Computer tracks)
- Calculates your GPA automatically using the real grade weights from syllabi
- Shows upcoming assignments and due dates
- Each course has its own color so it's easier to see what's what
- You can change due dates to match your actual syllabus
- Everything saves in your browser only

## How to Use It

### First Time Setup
1. Create an account (just pick a username and password - **only works in this browser**)
2. Choose your track (Electrical or Computer Engineering)
3. Start entering grades as you get them back

### Entering Grades
- Click on any course name to expand it
- Type in grades (0-100) for assignments, quizzes, labs, etc.
- Your GPA updates automatically

### Changing Due Dates

## Common Issues

### "I lost my grades!"
- Are you in the same browser you created the account in?
- Did you clear your browser data recently?
- Unfortunately, if browser data is cleared, grades can't be recovered

### "My account doesn't exist on my phone"
- Accounts don't sync between devices
- You'd need to create a separate account on each device you want to use

### "Wrong due dates?"
- Click on any date field to customize it for your section
- Each person can have different dates

### "My friend can't see my account"
- Each person needs their own account in their own browser
- Accounts are completely separate

## Tips
- **Use the same browser consistently** 
- **Don't clear your browser data** if you want to keep your grades
- Enter grades right when you get them back
- Set due dates to match what your profs actually assign
- Use the upcoming assignments section to see what's due soon
- Consider taking screenshots of your grades periodically as backup

## Lab Due Dates
All labs are set to be due **one week after** the lab session (not the day of the lab). You can adjust these if your section is different.
